<p>Researchers are currently using specific curation protocols to search for target genes in the NCBI or Ensembl databases, 
	find genes upstream of the target genes, and use the indices of these genes to download the non-coding DNA sequence between
	 the target and upstream or downstream gene. Two sets of files must be generated for each of these curations. The first set
	  of files includes sequences between the target gene and the next gene upstream of it regardless of which DNA strand the 
	  upstream gene occurs on.# These are referred to as "either" files. The second set of files includes sequences between the 
	  target gene and the next gene upstream of it on the same DNA strand it is on.# These are referred to as "same" files. 
	  The process of performing each curation via this protocol is error-prone and currently requires repetition, which is tedious
	   and time-consuming.
